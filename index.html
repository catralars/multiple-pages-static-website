        A croissant is crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough.
        
        The dough is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several times in a process called lamination. The
        final dough is cut into triangles and rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination results in a layered, flaky
        textured roll, more like puff pastry.
        
        The main ingredients in a croissant are flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk, water, eggs and butter.
        
        A well baked croissant should be flaky and crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. It should be evenly
        baked and well aerated.
